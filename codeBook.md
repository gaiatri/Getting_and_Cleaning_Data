This document provides information about the tidy data generated by the script run_analysis.R, also provided in this repository. 
The script performs step-by-step manipulation of the given "raw/messy data" to produce "tidy data" that conforms to the principles of tidy data as outlined in Hackley's paper.<sup>1</sup>


## Description of the data
-----------------------
The data was produced from an experiment conducted to analyse human activity recognition using smartphones. 
The experiment was performed on 2 different study groups, test and train, a total of 30 subjects. 

Source of the raw data:

## Data Dictionary for Tidy Data Set
 
Structure of tidy data set: Data frame
Dimensions of tidy data set: 180 * 68, plus a header row with descriptive variable names for the columns.
 
###Fixed variables a.k.a dimensions
The tidy data set is grouped by both of these dimension variables.

                           Subject identifier - type integer
                           1 - 30     Unique identifier assigned to each subject(volunteer) in the experiment.

### Measured variables	
	
There are 66 measured variables in the tidy data set. 
They are averages of either mean or standard deviation (normalized and scaled)measurements, calculated from the original data. 
All the variables are of type double (numeric) and are of slightly variable length, with most of the numbers having a precision of 15 digits.
Since the measurements are normalized, they are unitless.<sup>2</sup>
The numbers fall within the range [-1,1].

#### Glossary of component terms in the measured variables:
time - time domain of the sensor signal.
freq - frequency domain of the sensor signal.
Acc  - the linear acceleration component of the sensor signal obtained from accelerometer readings.
Gyro - the angular velocity component of the sensor signal obtained from gyroscope readings.
Body - the body motion component of acceleration or angular velocity.
Gravity - the gravitational motion component of acceleration.
Jerk - derivative of linear acceleration or angular velocity with respect to time.
Mag - magnitude component of linear acceleration or angular velocity without considering the direction.
JerkMag - magnitude component of jerk(derivative of linear acceleration or angular velocity) without considering the direction.
Mean - mean for several readings of that particular measurement.
Std  - standard deviation for several readings of that particular measurement.
X, Y, Z - 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions of the smartphone.
